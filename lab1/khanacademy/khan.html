        <h1>Words of Wisdom
        </h1>
        <p>Do not be like sheep,<br>

            Blindly following the herd,<br>

            Seek the truth, seek knowledge,<br>

            And live by your own word.<br>
            <br>

            
            Work hard, be kind, and just,<br>

            Stay honest, free of lies,<br>

            For wisdom comes to those<br>

            With open, questioning eyes.</p>
